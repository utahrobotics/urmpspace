#Read Me - Cole Mortensen
##About
My name is Cole Mortensen and I am a freshman computer engineering student. 
I grew up in Idaho Falls, ID and was the co-capitan of my schools FIRST Robotics team there.
I have interests in Raspberry Pi, Arduino, and other electronic things that combine hardware and software. Working with autonomous
drones is what I really want to do in my career. Over the summer, I was an intern at the Idaho National Lab and
was able to create a gps tracking system demonstration for their fleet vehicles.
##What I want to do on the team
I am interested in figuring out navigation for the robot but I will do anything to help get the project running.
I have some experience with Arduino, javascript and python and am learning c++. 
I am excited to learn ROS as it looks like an industry standard and will hopefully help me in my career.
##Edit number 1
This is a test to see if I can work smartGit on ubuntu
